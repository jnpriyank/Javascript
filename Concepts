Closures:
Lets say we have a IIFE module. and 
we are in a event handler method then -- all the private variables of the module and methods which are not at all used in the module itself 
won't be part of the closure.
Part of the closure will be :
  all variables and methods being used in the handler method which are outside the handler code.
  all variables and methods being used in any method outside the handler code and inside the module.
